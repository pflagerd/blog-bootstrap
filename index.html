        <p class="meta">2025-05-27 07:21 (UTC-7) by Daniel</p>
        <p>Added the new logo to the current page.  Result is pretty good.</p>
        <img style="width: 50%;" src="./img/Screenshot_20250527_072253.png" alt="snapshot of website progress">
        <p>It is positioned too high. It would be better if it were lower. Maybe it should be absolute positioned with a high z-index.</p>
        <p>The shaded overlay doesn't seem to resize with the rest of the window.  It should resize in such a way as to keep the whole viewable area covered.</p>
        <p>I figured it out. Because I translated the overlay upwards to get the text positioning right (by -10%), I need to make the overlay at least 10% bigger.</p>
        <p>112% seemed to work.</p>
        <p>Also, the overlay letters don't resize when the page resizes.</p>
        <p>Changing the font size to 24vw did the trick.</p>
        <p>Also adjusted front-page-image to occupy 85% of width. Looks more balanced.</p>

        <h3>Work on the email field and the button</h3>
        <p class="meta">The original wasn't great, but it would be a good exercise to get something like it working in any case.</p>
        <p class="meta">2025-05-23 07:30 (UTC-7) by Daniel</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://saltless-demo.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">original squarespace.com demo page</a> had the email field and the button styled like this:</p>
        <img style="width: 30%;" src="./img/Screenshot_20250523_072922.png" alt="snapshot of website progress">
        <p>I dislike a lot about it, except for the grouping and positions of the three elements relative to one another ("Sign up to receive news and updates", the email text box, and the button), and the right justification of the three elements together.</p>
        <p>I figured out (with ClaudeAI's help) how to group and style these three together and right-justify them.</p>
        <p>I also added overlayed stencil "COMING SOON!" text.</p>
        <p>Now the most glaring issue is the logo.  It looks pathetic.<p>  I think I should try to use AI to generate some logos.  Might also do some image searches for inspiration.</p>

        <h3>Experiment with a couple of visual elements on the website.</h3>

        <p class="meta">2025-05-22 06:40 (UTC-7) by Daniel</p>
        <p>Added img/logo.from-harry.png to the website for grins:</p>
        <img style="width: 90%;" src="./img/Screenshot_20250522_064132.png" alt="snapshot of website progress">
        <p>Next, I captured the image from the old sleepz.eu site and displayed it in the &lt;figure&gt; element.</p>
        <p>I got some advice from ClaudeAI on how to right justify it.</p>
        <p>Then I surfed the old site with Chrome and used its Developer Tools to look for the background color so I could match it.</p>
        <p>Turned out all I could find was a default color which was very close to white (not the same as the background color I could see) for the &lt;body&gt; element</p>
        <p>All the other elements' Computed background color was transparent: <code>background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);</code>.</p>
        <p>After some more surfing I found that the color was actually being set with a different property:</p>
        <img style="width: 50%;" src="./img/Screenshot_20250522_075254.png" alt="image of --siteBackgroundColor">
        <p>So I used that property on the sleepz website.  It looks like this now:</p>
        <img style="width: 90%;" src="./img/Screenshot_20250522_075646.png" alt="website with image aligned and the captured background color">
        <p>Incidentally, here's the original site that I'm trying to emulate:</p>

        <p>Putting information into the blog is a good idea.</p>
        <p>Figuring out what all the features and workflows of this project are and documenting it is going to be important.</p>
        <p>For now though, I need to focus on getting sleepz/website operational.</p>
        <p>It's not very compelling visually just yet, but it has been redesigned to be semantic HTML which should help with SEO.</p>
        <img style="width: 60%;" src="./img/Screenshot_20250521_072409.png" alt="image of sleepz/website running in a browser">
        <p>As I mentioned before, I was working through <a href="https://members.codewithmosh.com/courses/the-ultimate-html-css-part1-1/lectures/28672347" target="_blank">The Ultimate Html5 Css3 Course Part 1</a> to learn things usable for this issue.</p>
        <p>The course has been useful, and I should continue the learning, but I'm not getting a chance to rehearse what I've learned, so it's faded from memory.</p>
        <p>What if I made a bunch of code fiddles to rehearse that?</p>
        <p>Or what if I made a bunch of little html/css/javascript pages which are themselves self-contained fiddles.</p>
        <p>The goal is to make the sleepz/website look like the following, but adapted to a "Coming Soon" single page format.</p>
        <img style="width: 60%;" src="./img/Screenshot_20250521_073438.png" alt="image of what we want sleepz/website to resemble.">
        <p>So we need to style and populate the various parts of the web-page which are missing.</p>
        <p>The logo might be a good place to start.</p>
        <p>We have an issue on this: <a href="https://github.com/pflagerd/sleepz/issues/77" target="_blank">We need a logo (#77)</a>.</p>
        <p>Harry proposed a logo in an email a while back, but it doesn't look like the logo made it into te issue.</p>
        <p>I'll have to search my email history for it. I did some searching, but I couldn't find it.</p>
        <p>I'll email Harry.</p>
