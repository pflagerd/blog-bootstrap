            <p>It is interesting that Gayle should say "Receiving an offer is not about solving questions flawlessly (very
                few candidates do!). Rather, it is about <span title="what does this even mean?"><i>answering questions better than other candidates.</i>"</span>
                In particular, what does "answering questions better than other candidates" look like?</p>
            <p>Daniel also mused on the statement "It's about developing a fresh algorithm, not memorizing existing problems": What is a <i>fresh algorithm</i>?
                Is it an algorithm that is completely novel? That seems unlikely, because the interviewer is asking a question whose answer is known to him/her.
                Or perhaps the interviewer hopes to be surprised by some novel way of thinking or coding the solution?  Again, that seems unlikely since a seasoned interviewer will have asked the same question of many candidates, and will have seen many solutions to the same problem and few solutions will appear novel.
                Or perhaps the interviewer is looking for candidates who did something which the interviewer has seen before, but considered novel when he/she first saw the solution? This seems quite arbitrary, superficial and idiosyncratic - not respectful of the need for consistency across interviewers and candidates.
                Furthermore, it seems unlikely that "memorizing existing problems" is mutually exclusive with "developing a fresh algorithm". Doesn't one have to memorize existing techniques from a myriad of problems to be able to develop a fresh algorithm? Without some knowledge of existing techniques, the candidate would be unable to distinguish "fresh" from "how everybody solves it".
