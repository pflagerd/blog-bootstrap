            <p>It appears I need another argument after <code>flutter build</code>.</p>
            <p>I guess I'll try an apk, which I believe is APK (Android Package Kit). Essentially a .zip file with everything needed for Android deployment.</p>
            <pre>flutter build apk</pre>
            <p>This took a long time. I got bored after about 20 minutes.  <code>top</code> still shows java processes, so I guess things are still building...but it never finished.</p>

            <blockquote style="border-left: 1.5rem solid #ccc; padding-left: 0.3rem;">A pubspec.yaml file indicates you're working with a Dart or Flutter project. It's the package and project configuration file for the Dart ecosystem.</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p>Claude suggests I check my flutter setup with <code>flutter doctor</code></p>
            <img style="width: 100%" src="img/Screenshot_20260207_095528.png" alt="img/Screenshot 20260207_095528.png"/>
            <p>It complains about missing command line tools.  With Claude ai's help I find out how to install these from adroid studio.</p>
            <p>I learned I can launch android studio from the command line thus: <code>android-studio</code>.</p>
            <p>But I also created a quick launch for it.</p>
            <p>I then followed the steps it suggested which I have demonstrate in the following video:</p>
            <!-- TODO PUT YOUTUBE EMBEDDING HERE -->
            <p>Now I will check if that has fixed the issue in flutter</p>
            <p>When I reran <code>flutter doctor</code>, it was from a WebStorm terminal.  Whatever was happening, everything on the VM went semi-frozen.</p>
            <p>WebStorm was terminated by the OS and an "Out of Memory" dialog was displayed.</p>
            <p>After a little research, it became clear that WebStorm and Android Studio cannot run on the same VM.  They're both memory hogs.</p>
            <p>According to <code>top</code> the VM only has 7936 MiB of memory, of which only 173 MiB is free.</p>
            <p>I wonder if I can increase the VM's memory?</p>
            <p>Answer is Yes.  I doubled it.</p>
            <p>Let's try <code>flutter doctor</code> again:</p>

If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.

4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.

5. Your Developer Credentials

5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer credentials.

7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.

8. Using Android APIs

8.1 Google Data APIs

8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

THE EVALUATION MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES ONLY AND MAY NOT BE MODIFIED (EXCEPT TO FACILITATE THE INTERNAL EVALUATION) OR DISTRIBUTED BY RECIPIENT OR INCORPORATED INTO RECIPIENT’S PRODUCTS OR SOFTWARE. PLEASE CONTACT A MIPS SALES REPRESENTATIVE TO LEARN ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF A COMMERCIAL VERSION OF THE EVALUATION SOFTWARE.

3. TITLE. Title to the Evaluation Materials remains with MIPS or its suppliers. Recipient shall not mortgage, pledge or encumber the Evaluation Materials in any way. Recipient shall return all Evaluation Materials, keeping no copies, upon termination or expiration of this Agreement.

4. LICENSE. MIPS grants Recipient a royalty-free, personal, nontransferable, nonexclusive license under its copyrights to use the Evaluation Software only for the purposes described in paragraph 2 above and only for a period beginning on the Effective Date and extending to the first anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Evaluation Period”). Unless otherwise communicated in writing by MIPS to Recipient, to the extent the Evaluation Software is provided in more than one delivery or release (each, a “Release”) the license grant in this Section 4 and the Evaluation Period shall apply to each Release, in which case the Evaluation Period shall begin on the date that the Release is made generally available and continue to the first anniversary of such date. Recipient may not make modifications to the Evaluation Software. Recipient shall not disassemble, reverse-engineer, or decompile any software that is not provided to Recipient in source code form.


EXCEPT AS PROVIDED HEREIN, NO OTHER LICENSE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, BY ESTOPPEL OR OTHERWISE, TO ANY OTHER MIPS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS GRANTED TO THE RECIPIENT. OTHER THAN AS EXPLICITLY SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 2 ABOVE, NO RIGHT TO COPY, TO REPRODUCE, TO MODIFY, OR TO CREATE DERIVATIVE WORKS OF, THE EVALUATION MATERIALS IS GRANTED HEREIN.

5. NO OBLIGATION. Recipient shall have no duty to purchase or license any product from MIPS. MIPS and its suppliers shall have no obligation to provide support for, or develop a non-evaluation version of, the Evaluation Software or to license any version of it.

6. MODIFICATIONS. This Agreement does not obligate Recipient to provide MIPS with comments or suggestions regarding Evaluation Materials. However, should Recipient provide MIPS with comments or suggestions for the modification, correction, improvement or enhancement of (a) the Evaluation Materials or (b) MIPS products or processes which may embody the Evaluation Materials, then Recipient agrees to grant and hereby grants to MIPS a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense MIPS’ licensees and customers, under Recipient’s Intellectual property rights, to use and disclose such comments and suggestions in any manner MIPS chooses and to display, perform, copy, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise dispose of MIPS’ and its sublicensee’s products embodying such comments and suggestions in any manner and via any media MIPS chooses, without reference to the source.

7. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER. MIPS AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO EVALUATION MATERIALS, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. RECIPIENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE EVALUATION MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. MIPS AND ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY PROPERTY DAMAGE, PERSONAL INJURY, LOSS OF PROFITS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS OR FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED OR ALLEGED, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, UNDER TORT OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY. MIPS AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY, INCLUDING LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY KIND RELATING TO THE EVALUATION MATERIALS.

9. EXPIRATION. MIPS may terminate this Agreement immediately after a breach by Recipient or otherwise at MIPS’ reasonable discretion and upon five (5) business days’ notice to Recipient.

10. GENERAL.

10.1 Controlling Law. This Agreement shall be governed by California law excluding its choice of law rules. With the exception of MIPS’ rights to enforce its intellectual property rights and any confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, all disputes and any claims arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Each party hereby agrees to jurisdiction and venue in the courts set forth in the preceding sentence. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the above courts.

10.2 Remedies. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, as well as any disclosure, commercialization, or public use of the Evaluation Materials, would cause irreparable injury to MIPS, and therefore Recipient agrees to consent to, and hereby consents to, the grant of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of an actual or threatened breach.

10.3 Assignment. Recipient may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license granted or any of Recipient’s rights, obligations, or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, by way of merger (regardless of whether Recipient is the surviving entity) or acquisition, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without MIPS’ express prior written consent, shall be ineffective, null and void. MIPS may freely assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.

10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Recipient and MIPS and supersedes in their entirety any and all oral or written agreements previously existing between Recipient and MIPS with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended or supplemented by a writing that refers explicitly to this Agreement and that is signed or otherwise accepted by duly authorized representatives of Recipient and MIPS.

10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally adjudicated to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such unenforceable or invalid provision shall be interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.

10.6 Export Regulations / Export Control. Recipient shall not export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the Evaluation Materials without first obtaining any required license or other necessary approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governing agency or department of the United States Government. In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws. An export is "deemed" to take place when information is released to a foreign national wherever located.

10.7 Special Terms for Pre-Release Materials. If so indicated in the description of the Evaluation Software, the Evaluation Software may contain Pre-Release Materials. Recipient hereby understands, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Pre-Release Materials may not be fully tested and may contain bugs or errors; (ii) Pre-Release materials are not suitable for commercial release in their current state; (iii) regulatory approvals for Pre-Release Materials (such as UL or FCC) have not been obtained, and Pre-Release Materials may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments or may not be suitable for certain applications and (iv) MIPS can provide no assurance that it will ever produce or make generally available a production version of the Pre-Release Materials . MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.

ANY PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS ARE NON-QUALIFIED AND, AS SUCH, ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS, AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

10.8 Open Source Software. In the event Open Source software is included with Evaluation Software, such Open Source software is licensed pursuant to the applicable Open Source software license agreement identified in the Open Source software comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header as indicated in the Evaluation Software. Additional detail may be available (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation. With respect to the Open Source software, nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable Open Source software license agreement.

    Because test >=1.26.3 <1.27.0 depends on analyzer >=6.0.0 <9.0.0 and test >=1.25.9 <1.26.3 depends
      on analyzer >=6.0.0 <8.0.0, test >=1.25.9 <1.27.0 requires analyzer >=6.0.0 <9.0.0.
    And because test >=1.17.10 <1.20.0 depends on analyzer >=1.0.0 <3.0.0, test >=1.17.10 <1.20.0-∞ or
      >=1.25.9 <1.27.0-∞ requires analyzer >=1.0.0 <3.0.0 or >=6.0.0 <9.0.0.
    And because test >=1.16.6 <1.17.10 depends on analyzer ^1.0.0 and isar_generator 3.1.0+1 depends on
      analyzer >=4.6.0 <6.0.0, test >=1.16.6 <1.20.0-∞ or >=1.25.9 <1.27.0-∞ is incompatible with
      isar_generator 3.1.0+1.
    Because no versions of mocktail match >0.3.0 <0.4.0 and mocktail 0.3.0 depends on test ^1.16.0,
      mocktail ^0.3.0 requires test ^1.16.0.
(1) Thus, if mocktail ^0.3.0 and isar_generator 3.1.0+1 then test >=1.16.0 <1.16.6-∞ or >=1.20.0
      <1.25.9-∞ or >=1.27.0 <2.0.0.

    Because test >=1.21.2 <1.21.3 depends on test_api 0.4.10 and test >=1.21.3 <1.21.4 depends on
      test_api 0.4.11, test >=1.21.2 <1.21.4 requires test_api 0.4.10 or 0.4.11.

      test_api 0.4.10 or 0.4.11 or 0.4.12.
    And because test >=1.24.3 <1.25.13 depends on matcher >=0.12.16 <0.12.17 and test >=1.24.0 <1.24.3

      >=1.20.0 <1.21.2-∞ or >=1.21.5 <1.24.0-∞ or >=1.27.0 <2.0.0.
    And because every version of flutter_test from sdk depends on matcher 0.12.17, if mocktail ^0.3.0
      and isar_generator 3.1.0+1 and flutter_test from sdk then test_api 0.4.10 or 0.4.11 or 0.4.12 or test

    And because test >=1.29.0 depends on test_api 0.7.9 and test >=1.27.0 <1.29.0 depends on test_api
      0.7.8, if mocktail ^0.3.0 and isar_generator 3.1.0+1 and flutter_test from sdk then test_api 0.4.10 or

      test_api 0.4.17, if mocktail ^0.3.0 and isar_generator 3.1.0+1 and flutter_test from sdk then test_api

    And because test >=1.21.6 <1.21.7 depends on test_api 0.4.14 and test >=1.21.5 <1.21.6 depends on

    And because test >=1.20.0 <1.21.2 depends on test_api 0.4.9 and test >=1.16.0-nullsafety.19 <1.16.6
      depends on test_api 0.2.19, if mocktail ^0.3.0 and isar_generator 3.1.0+1 and flutter_test from sdk then

      or 0.4.18 or 0.7.8 or 0.7.9.
    And because playback depends on flutter_test from sdk which depends on test_api 0.7.7, mocktail
      ^0.3.0 is incompatible with isar_generator 3.1.0+1.
    So, because playback depends on both isar_generator 3.1.0+1 and mocktail ^0.3.0, version solving
      failed.

            <p>Claude says to do this:</p>
            <iframe style="width: 60%;" src="html/Installing%20Android%20Studio%20on%20Linux%20-%20Claude%20(2_3_2026%201：11：18%20PM).html"></iframe>
            <p></p>
            <p>So I navigated to <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target="_blank">https://developer.android.com/studio</a>, and scrolled down until I found <code>android-studio-2025.2.3.9-linux.tar.gz</code> which I downloaded.</p>
            <p>I downloaded the file, extracted it and moved the resulting <code>android-studio/</code> to my VM's desktop.</p>
            <p>I then surfed to the <code>android-studio/bin/studio</code> executable and ran it.</p>
            <p>After some time the main screen appeared.</p>
            <img style="width: 100%;" src="img/Screenshot_20260203_145450.png" alt="img/Screenshot_20260203_145450.png">
            <p>Then I opened playback with it.</p>
            <p>That didn't amount to much, so I got Claude.ai to help me by asking it what <code>pubspec.yaml</code> was. Claude responded that this was a flutter app.</p>
            <p>It then asked me to do something by typing <code>flutter</code> in a terminal.  This didn't work, because flutter is not installed.</p>
            <p>It suggested I install it thus:</p>
            <pre>kubuntu-jamie-game:~/Downloads> sudo snap install flutter --classic
flutter 0+git.1fa6fd6 from Flutter Team✓ installed</pre>
            <p>I suggested I install Android Studio thus:</p>
            <pre>kubuntu-jamie-game:~/Downloads> sudo snap install android-studio --classic
android-studio 2025.1.3.7-wallpapers from Snapcrafters✪ installed</pre>
            <p>So I trashed the one on my desktop and deleted the tar.gz.</p>
            <p>Actually, I had to also add a Trash icon to my Plasma panel, and then I could empty the trash.</p>
            <p>It suggested I use snap to install vscode, but I had already installed it from the repo (see prior articles)</p>

            <h3>How I set up a development environment for kubuntu-jamie-game</h3>
            <p class="meta">Having got a workable kubuntu environment, I'm ready to configure some development tools.</p>
            <p class="meta">2026-02-03 11:22 (UTC-8) by Daniel</p>
            <p>Jamie recommends installing vscode.</p>
            <p>Here's how I did it.</p>
            <pre style="overflow-x: auto;"># Step 1: Install the .deb package directly
wget "https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=linux-deb-x64" -O ./vscode.deb
sudo apt install ./vscode.deb

# Step 2: Add the Microsoft repository for future updates
wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > packages.microsoft.gpg
sudo install -D -o root -g root -m 644 packages.microsoft.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg

echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64,armhf signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list

# Step 3: Update apt cache
sudo apt update</pre>
            <p>When I ran this I got:</p>
            <pre style="overflow-x: auto;">deb [arch=amd64,arm64,armhf signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main
Error: Conflicting values set for option Signed-By regarding source https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code/ stable: /usr/share/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg != /usr/share/keyrings/microsoft.gpg
Error: The list of sources could not be read.</pre>
            <p>After futzing with Claude AI, I did this:</p>
            <pre>grep -r "packages.microsoft.com/repos/code" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
grep "packages.microsoft.com/repos/code" /etc/apt/sources.list
</pre>
            <p>Which produced these two files:</p>
            <pre style="overflow-x: auto;">/etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list:deb [arch=amd64,arm64,armhf signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.sources:URIs: https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code</pre>
            <p>which I deleted:</p>
            <pre style="overflow-x: auto;">sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.sources</pre>
            <p>At least that's the advice Claude offered.</p>
            <p>Where did vscode get installed?</p>
            <pre style="overflow-x: auto;">kubuntu-jamie-game:~/desktops/Default> which code
/usr/bin/code</pre>
            <p>I created a quicklaunch launcher.</p>
            <p>I ran up code using the new launcher, and changed the theme to Solarized Light.</p>
            <p>I then searched for the plugin "Flutter" which I found:</p>

            <p>I installed it, and found that it had automatically installed Dart support also:</p>

            <p>Jamie pointed out that I already forked <code>git@github.com:pflagerd/playback.git</code>.</p>
            <img src="img/Screenshot_20260203_115305.png" alt="img/Screenshot_20260203_115305.png">
            <p>Here's what it contains:</p>

            <p>I think that's enough for now.  Gonna get a bite of lunch.</p>

            <p>I created a new public key</p>
            <pre>ssh-keygen &lt;return&gt;
&lt;return&gt;
&lt;return&gt;
&lt;return&gt;
&lt;return&gt;</pre>
            <p>This created a new private and public key:</p>
            <img src="img/Screenshot_20260202_143906.png" alt="img/Screenshot_20260202_143906.png">
            <p>Next, I installed Google Chrome: (See <a href="https://claude.ai/share/e8dd76e3-5564-49b7-bec9-c6c3ffad8ad3" target="_blank">Claude AI Method 1.</a>)</p>
            <pre>wget -q -O - https://dl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/google-chrome.gpg
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/google-chrome.gpg] http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install google-chrome-stable</pre>
            <p>I needed Chrome so I could share the key everywhere.</p>
            <p>After installing Chrome, I turned on Sync.</p>
            <p>Then I copied <code>id_ed25519.pub</code>'s contents to github.com and sourceforge.net.</p>
            <p>Then I cloned the <code>self/</code> directory from sourceforge:</p>
            <pre>git clone git clone ssh://pflagerd@git.code.sf.net/p/pflagerd/self pflagerd-self</pre>
            <p>...and then copied its contents over-top ~/home/oy753c:</p>
            <pre>cp -a pflagerd-self/. ~/</pre>
            <p>Then I opened a new console window to make sure the updated scripts worked.</p>
            <p>There were some small errors, which I've forgotten, but the process basically worked.</p>
            <p>I made sure Chromium was also installed.</p>
            <p>I cloned <a href="https://github.com/pflagerd/blog-bootstrap" target="_blank">https://github.com/pflagerd/blog-bootstrap</a> to ~/Desktop/blog (AKA ~/desktops/Default/blog)</p>
            <p>I then added logic to allow the blog to update when changing it, and committed that.</p>
            <p>Now being pretty confident in the modifications made to /home/oy753c (AKA ~/) by pflagerd-self, I trashed that directory:</p>
            <pre>rm -rf pflagerd-self</pre>
            <p>I then added Chrome, Chromium, Kate and WebStorm to the quicklaunch widget.</p>
