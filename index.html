            <p>Example 12s explanation finally became a little clear to us after running Daniel's <code>dpp/p51/</code> code implemented in Linux using IntelliJ IDEA with a no-jar unit test framework.</p>
            <p>We decided that the choice of variable names was creating cognitive dissonance for us so we renamed some.</p>
            <p><code>string</code> and <code>prefix</code> became <code>input</code> and <code>output</code>.  <code>rem</code>, which we though might be short for "remainder" became <code>residue</code>.</p>
            <p>We also decided to extract a function <code>removeCharAt(String, int)</code> to make the code more understandable.</p>
            <p>We realized that the <code>System.out.println(prefix);</code> line would be called exactly N! times.</p>
            <p>We put in a counter <code>j</code> to see how many times the overloaded <code>permutation()</code> was called.  That produced an interesting sequence: </p>

            <p>Example 1 and 2 gave us no pause.</p>
            <p>In Example 3, Daniel recognized the code as a kind of implementation similar to computing "triangular numbers":</p>
            <img style="width: 25%;" src="img/Screenshot_20251208_102807.png" alt="Example 3 code">
            <p><a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/triangular-numbers.html" target="_blank">Triangular numbers are fun</a> because there is a formula for computing them: $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$</p>
            <p>Example 4 gave Daniel some new data, because he was unused to thinking of the time complexity of a nested loop in two independent variables as O(AB).</p>
            <p>After doing some quick research on Chat GPT, we concluded that using O(AB) was at a minimum "more correct", and that we were unfamiliar with it probably because in GeeksForGeeks and Sedgewick and other sources we have been learning from such algorithms were often just considered O($N^2$).</p>
            <p>Example 8 really fobbed us up because it involved two variables, which we didn't recognize.  One variable for the length of the strings in the array, and another length for the number of elements in the array itself.  We correctly reasoned that sorting each string was likely O(s log s) complexity (s stands for string length), but we did not
            account for the fact that there were a strings to sort (a stands for array length) for a total of O(a(s log s)), nor did we realize that sorting the array itself also involved both comparing strings O(s) and sorting array elements O(a log a) (one comparison per sort operation) for a total of O(s(a log a)).</p>
            <p>Thus the grand total would have been O(a(s log s)) + O(s(a log a)) = O(a(s log s) + s(a log a)) = O(as(log s + log a))</p>
            <p>Example 10 had an interesting nuance.  In the case of this prime number algorithm, we ended up with O($\sqrt N$) complexity, because the algorithm was only checking up to the square root of N for factors.  In such a case, $\sqrt N$ is the dominant term, so we use it as the argument in O($\sqrt N$).</p>
            <p>This brings us to Example 12.  It involves permutations of a string, but neither of us can visualize what's really happening with it, so we decided we should code it up by next time and be ready to run it with some test cases to see if we can get a better sense of what it's doing during our next session.</p>
            <p>Daniel created a directory <code>/dpp</code> to contain a java file P51 containing the code, a minimal test framework, and a few tests. All can be run in IntelliJ IDEA.</p>

            <p>We looked ahead a bit and found that chapters III, IV and V were more information about interviewing.</p>
            <p>Chapter VI seems to be the first chapter concerned with data structures and algorithms.</p>
            <p><label><input type="checkbox" checked> </label>We decided to jump ahead to <a href="Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview%20189%20Programming%20Questions%20and%20Solutions.pdf#page=49" target="_blank">VI Big-O</a></p>
            <p>Working through this we came upon a discussion of "amortized time".  The example given was of a dynamic array.  The array is initialized with a fixed size, but when it is full, a new array is created with double the size and the elements are copied over.  This operation is expensive, but it only happens occasionally.  The amortized time complexity of the array operations is O(1), because the cost of the occasional resize operation is spread out over all the operations.</p>
            <p>But this wasn't really explained well.  We decided to skip ahead to Log N Runtimes.</p>
            <p>We reached <a href="Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview%20189%20Programming%20Questions%20and%20Solutions.pdf#page=56" target="_blank">Examples and Exercises on p45</a>.</p>
            <p>We decided to continue there next time by working through each example by NOT looking at the answer first, but just scrolling to see enough code to attempt the answer.</p>

            <p>It is interesting that Gayle should say "Receiving an offer is not about solving questions flawlessly (very
                few candidates do!). Rather, it is about <span title="what does this even mean?"><i>answering questions better than other candidates.</i>"</span>
                In particular, what does "answering questions better than other candidates" look like?</p>
            <p>Daniel also mused on the statement "It's about developing a fresh algorithm, not memorizing existing problems": What is a <i>fresh algorithm</i>?
                Is it an algorithm that is completely novel? That seems unlikely, because the interviewer is asking a question whose answer is known to him/her.
                Or perhaps the interviewer hopes to be surprised by some novel way of thinking or coding the solution?  Again, that seems unlikely since a seasoned interviewer will have asked the same question of many candidates, and will have seen many solutions to the same problem and few solutions will appear novel.
                Or perhaps the interviewer is looking for candidates who did something which the interviewer has seen before, but considered novel when he/she first saw the solution? This seems quite arbitrary, superficial and idiosyncratic - not respectful of the need for consistency across interviewers and candidates.
                Furthermore, it seems unlikely that "memorizing existing problems" is mutually exclusive with "developing a fresh algorithm". Doesn't one have to memorize existing techniques from a myriad of problems to be able to develop a fresh algorithm? Without some knowledge of existing techniques, the candidate would be unable to distinguish "fresh" from "how everybody solves it".
