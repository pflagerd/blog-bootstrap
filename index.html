            <p>We started reading today at <a href="../Arun%20Sharma%20Quantitative%20Aptitude%208th%20Edition.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">5. Use of percentages to multiply</a></p>
            <p>We finished Chapter 4.  All the chapters were underwhelming. </p>

            <p>Interesting procedure for multiplication, allegedly based on a Trachtenberg technique which is also a Vedic technique.</p>
            <p>We both feel that while this is interesting, it is not likely to be something we invest time to build skill in.</p>
            <p>We almost finished, but need to resume at <a href="../Arun%20Sharma%20Quantitative%20Aptitude%208th%20Edition.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">5. Use of percentages to multiply</a></p>

            <p>The subtraction process doesn't seem seem like an inverse function to the addition process described earlier.</p>
            <p>Picking two digits first, then one digit rather than one digit, one digit, and one digit doesn't seem inherently more powerful.  It just feels cludgy.</p>

            <h3>We re-engage with the Sharma book</h3>
            <p class="meta">We think we could learn something about how Indians learn math via this book. Not so much to pass a test, but to get some benefit of an education system we didn't get to experience.</p>

            <p>We read through Chapter 1 - IDEAS FOR ADDING AND SUBTRACTING WELL. We observed a useful technique to add using no more than two digits at once, even when adding gigantic numbers.</p>
            <p>We thought this to be interesting, but not high ROI for practice for our purposes.</p>
            <p>Are there similar skills analogous to addition useful in solving algorithm and data structure problems which consume much time and could be optimized?</p>
